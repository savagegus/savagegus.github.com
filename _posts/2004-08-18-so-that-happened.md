I was on the bike trip yesterday and about half way through I screwed up and locked my back tire this made me skid off the road into gravel and I was launched over my handle bars and I landed more or less on my head. My helmet saved my life. WEAR YOUR FREAKIN HELMET. Anyway my face is kinda smashed up and I have some whiplash. Also my front teeth are pretty smashed, I'm going to the dentist this morning about 11. Hopefully I'll be pretty set after that. I'll put some pictures up at least of the helmet as soon as I can.
