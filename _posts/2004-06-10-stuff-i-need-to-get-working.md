    			So I have decided to sell my g4 iBook. I don't need it anymore really and someone should have it. Plus it wouldn't hurt to have the money. I have to say I'm writing this with a bit of sorrow. I had a lot of trouble with my last iBook (a g3 with 4 major hardware failures in a year before I could get apple to replace it). However I have enjoyed the current one a lot and will miss a lot of the 'just freakin works' parts of it. Almost more I will miss all the really interesting software that people make for this platform. I am heartfelt in my suppport of open software, I just hope the community can become more innovative with the software they write.

Blah. Anyway, my new side project is moving all my devices over to my desktop. The current list is:<br>

-iPod<br>
-casio digital camera<br>
-little hp printer<br>

-canon scanner<br>
-all my music and movies<br>
-usb tv tuner ... myth tv ...<br>

Yeah. As soon as I can access all my devices I'll be putting this laptop on ebay. If anyone is interested let me know, mattfinlayson at mac dot com. (Can't spam scripts get around that by now?)
