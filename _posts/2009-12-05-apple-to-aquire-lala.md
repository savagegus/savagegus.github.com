<p>One reason Lala may not have taken off is that people do not necessarily want to entrust their music collection to the servers of a start-up whose prospects are uncertain. There would be no such uncertainty with Apple.</p>

<p>I actually think lala was close to popping, Jamie found it and turned me on to it, the facebook integration was cool. Also the full one time preview had me going there to explore new music rather than Amazon or Emusic.</p>
<p>After the stellar job Apple did with MobileMe I&#8217;d be less interested in Apple, also I&#8217;m sick of apple as a content provider. They do a great job of opening the door (ala TV and Music through the app store) but they are controlling and they lock me into their hardware. LAME.</p>

<p>This person said Apple would primarily be buying Lalas engineers, including its energetic co-founder Bill Nguyen, and their experience with cloud-based music services.</p>

<p>I do find this interesting for something like the iPhone, you don&#8217;t need as much space on the device if you can stream your music collection, some of us have music collections waaay to big to fit anytime soon. Great for mobile device owners, sucks to be bandwidth providers though.</p>
