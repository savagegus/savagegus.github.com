<p>It&#8217;s the holiday season yet again. Usually I participate in holiday charities though work, but this year there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much going on in the office beyond yearly charity contribution commitments. I got a catalog from Heifer International yesterday and after a little bit of background checking I&#8217;ve decided that this year I&#8217;m going to go with it.</p>
<p>I like the option of Bees in the catalog and the ability to donate as little as $10 for a concrete cause. You can find the <a href="http://www.heifer.org/site/c.edJRKQNiFiG/b.204586/?msource=pog">online catalog on their website</a>.</p>
<p>Before you make any contribution to a charity you should do a little homework, for reference &#8220;<a href="http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/2007/11/20/3-things-you-need-to-know-before-giving-to-charity/%20">Things you need to know before giving to a charity</a>&#8221;.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heifer_International">wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>Heifer International works to ensure that the gift of each animal will eventually help an entire community to become self-sustaining. Animals such as goats, water buffalo and camels are &#8220;seven M&#8221; animals: they provide meat, milk, muscle, manure, money, materials and motivation. Once its immediate needs have been met, a family is free to sell any excess at market. Heifer International provides a breeding animal along with the gift animal so that it can produce offspring. Participating families are required to &#8220;pass on the gift&#8221;, that is: they must give at least one of the female offspring to a neighbor who has undergone Heifer&#8217;s training. In time, that neighbor will pass along one of the offspring of its animal, and so on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A 2007 report by the Better Business Bureau&#8217;s Wise Giving Alliance (WGA) found that Heifer International met all of its standards for charity accountability</blockquote>
