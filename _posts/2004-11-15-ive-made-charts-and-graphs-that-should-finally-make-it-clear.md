<p>So, like usual it's been too long since I posted. Lots of things have happend etc, etc. First of buzzco and I beat X-Men legends. kinda anti climatic, but a cool game either way. Tim came up for a day last weekend and we damaged ourselves with suicide wings from planet wings.</p>

<p>So I lied about lots of stuff happening...</p>

<p>In other news I lost the password to zoneedit.com (they manage my dns entries) and now I can't get unsure.org released. They have a 'call me and tell me my password' they haven't called yet. All this after setting up an old hp as a router/server for buzzco and unsure.</p>

<p>Do any of you guys use gmail? It's my primary email address at this point but I havn't found a good way to check it. I tried the mail notification applet but I think it's the most horrible piece of software ever. If I start my machine without a network connection it just blinks, and blinks, and blinks. All the while refusing to check my mail. If it does work it just tells me with a notification window. I had it set to open firefox but once in a while it thinks I didn't actually check the mail and just keeps opening firefox. Buzzco suggested just making it my home page, but I don't know about that one.</p>
