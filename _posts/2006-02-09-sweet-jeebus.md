<p>I find the longer I leave this site alone the more likely it will be that I won't update. I think laziness has a lot more inertia than I can deal with. Anyway, although I haven't posted recently I've been doing a lot with this site. Unsure.org and a couple other sites are hosted on this server and although unsure only averages about 1,000 hits a day when I'm updating zetanu.net my fraternities alumni site takes a lot of hits. On top of that it's running Mambo and MySQL which is not a light combination. The UML image I had it on just couldn't take the load anymore and it was seriously starting to freak out. Needless to say I've upgraded. On top of having a speedier UML image I also upgraded from Debian 3.0 to ubuntu breezy. The change isn't that huge but it's so nice developing and hosting on the same platform. On top of that migrating from one to the other is pretty simple, certianly a lot easier than moving from sles to redhat or something like that. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>matt out.&nbsp;</p>
