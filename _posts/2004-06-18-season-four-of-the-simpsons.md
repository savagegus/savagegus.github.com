I own all four seasons of the Simpsons on dvd. That's all they've released so far even though they are on their 13th season if I'm not mistaken. At one a year it's a bummer I'll be 32 before they'll all be out. And that's just assuming the show is over this year. Oh well. If that's the biggest pain in my ass, I'll live a happy life. All that being said I think the fourth season is wicked funny, I hadn't realized that so many of my favorite episodes came in this season. I just watched Marge vs. the Monorail. That's about all.
