So I just set up pyblosxom (that sucks to spell) clarkbw has been a fan of this style blogging engine, the original blosxom is written in perl. That's not my bag at all, I avoid perl if it can be helped ... I blame horn. Anyway, pyblosxom is a reimplementation of blosxom in python, the greatest language ever. Frear not faithful readers, fromage goes on, however it will be used to run zetanu.net well, not right now, but after my thesis is done. I plan on using it to tie different webservices together for a community site for the alumni of my fraternity. So that's where it stands I guess. Now back to work. Also this flavour needs tuning, but that's work for another time.</p>
