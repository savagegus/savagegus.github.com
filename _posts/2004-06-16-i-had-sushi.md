    			So last night I went out with Jay Huie and company and had sushi for the first time. It was actually pretty good. The started with spiced soybeans and sake. Then miso (broth with tofu and seaweed) and sake. Then salad with mashed carrot and ginger as a dressing and sake. Then I had the sushi regular, with sake. The sushi itself was pretty good. I was surprised by the texture, i expected it to be cold, and firmer than it was. But it wasn't bad, soft and for the most part not too much taste, or easily overwelmed by the soy sauce and wasabi. My favorite I think was the salmon, it tasted good and I think it had the most appetizing texture and taste. The rolls were pretty good too but they were kinda hard to eat because if you tried to bite them in half they just fell apart so it seemed like the single giant bite was the best bet. The only thing that really grossed me out was the squid which was really horrible in many ways and the mackerel was really oily/fishy and I wasn't too big on that. Definately an interesting experience though and I'd try it again no problem.

That's about it.
