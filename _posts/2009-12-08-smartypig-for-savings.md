<p><a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartyPig</a> is a great tool for savings. It&#8217;s a bank account, but different. I&#8217;ve been using it for 6 months now and it&#8217;s helped my finances quite a bit and let me buy a few toys without feeling bad about it. It works pretty simply.</p>
<p>You create a FDIC Insured Bank Account with <a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartyPig</a>.</p>
<p>You create a savings goal with a date, ex. $400 for a new iPhone in July 2010</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartyPig</a> determines your required monthy contribution (-2% interest you make on the account.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.smartypig.com/">SmartPig</a> will automatically withdraw that amount from your bank account every month until your goal is met.</p>
<p>Then you can:</p>
<ul><li>Transfer the money to your bank account to use</li>
<li>Receive a debit card for the account from smarty pig</li>
<li>Receive a gift card for the Amount with a chosen vendor. <a href="http://www.smartypig.com/about/best-in-class">Each vendor adds a percentage</a> to the account. ex. Amazon adds 4% to the total. </li>
</ul><p>If something goes wrong and you need the money:</p>
<ul><li>You can cancel any automatic payment</li>
<li>You can withdraw your funds from the account</li>
</ul><p>You can also share savings goals through facebook or twitter, you can have others contribute to the account. This feature doesn&#8217;t really interest me and I don&#8217;t use it, however I could see running a charity drive through it or saving for a vacation or college with family &#8230; maybe. I still don&#8217;t like the idea of being too public with your money.</p>
<p>In all though, I love it. It&#8217;s like a Bank meets Layaway, and it&#8217;s way more responsible than a credit card.</p>
