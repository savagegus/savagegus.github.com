<p>It’s almost 9 and I’m stuck. I live between the willamette river and the railroad tracks. Wrong side of th etracks? Today, probably. 3 or 4 times a day the train goes by and If you don’t climb the massive set of stairs next to my apartmene is a gorgeous powder blue porshe) waiting for the train to clear the road.<br />
The train appears to be w bad but there is that god awful beEEL LIKE I’m a part of the west coast in a small way. Although the graffiti and oil cars mixed in with the lumber cars reminds me it is a new age.<br />

The train has passed and a cup of coffee and donut later I’m on a wooden bench in Jamison Square park. A week later and a couple hours later there are a lot more folks out and about so the Genius playlist is built off of The Avette Brothers – Go to sleep.<br />
I’ve been in Portland for a little more than 3 months and our apartment is getting to be more like home than it used to be. We got the main things squared away quickly, couch, tv, bed and office. As time goes on though I’ve been filling in the gaps. This weeks project was the stereo.<br />
A month after moving I made the switch to a mac. I’ll talk about that more some other time but it’s part of the story today so I mention it. I’ve drank the koolaid and so now in my apartment is the macbook, my iphone, and an airport express. This let me get a pretty awesome music setup going. ]<br />
With 250 GB of disk in the laptop my whole music collection actually lives on the macbook and iTunes lets me organize the whole thing, but I’ve been listening to it through the tiny laptop speakers, which are decent but not the same as a real stero.<br />
Jamie and I cook a lot, she’s a chef so making a big dinner turns into an activity that I look forward to. In the past we’ve had a laptop playing some tunes or the TV singing away across the room but like I said it’s not the same, but I cloudn’t think of a convienent way to get the tunes to the stero. Enter 2 things. The remote application for the iPhone and the airport express.<br />
The remote application connects to iTunes and gives you the iPod touch interface to the computer’s iTunes library. The Airport Express exetends the wireless network and has 2 outputs one to hook up a wireless printer (which I don’t use, thanks CUPS) and the other streams music over wireless from iTunes. With the two combined Jamie or I can cue up anything we want to hear while we cook. I love it when a plan comes together.</p>
