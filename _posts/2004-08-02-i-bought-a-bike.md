I finally broke down and bought a mountian bike. Jeff Bisti came along and helped me out. I get to pick it up tommorow and it should be badass. I got the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041205135131/http://www.giantbicycles.com/us/030.000.000/030.000.000.asp?dealerid=&dealercountry=&lYear=2004&bikesection=8841&range=145&model=10773">Giant Iguana</a> in red and black. </p>
<p>I have a wacom tablet setup on my desktop which is cool. Hopefully I'll have more time to play with it. I don't often have anything to post about work, but I did get a laptop upgrade now I have a T30. It's running gentoo and XP at the moment. Also, I scanned more photos.
