<p>Today Mike, Danielle, Jay and I went for a winter hike down in Cold Springs. It was like a 3 mile walk with a few obstacles.. I got a few good photos which are now in my gallery. You can see them in my <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060427163653/http://unsure.org/gallery/view_album.php?set_albumName=album01&page=1" title="Gallery"> gallery</a>.<br /></p>
