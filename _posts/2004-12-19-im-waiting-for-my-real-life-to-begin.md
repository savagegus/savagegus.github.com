<p>As I fondled Cantia, my pillow girlfriend, I thought about how much things have changed in the past few weeks ...

<p>Yeah, so things have been going down. I finished my masters thesis finally. Word to the wise, do not try to finish up with your masters thesis while you work full time. it'll break your spirit. Anyway it's done now, so I have my life back.</p> 

<p>I've done some web stuff recently you can see at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050305133544/http://planetcosi.org/">planetcosi</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050305133544/http://ironturtle.org/">ironturtle</a>.</p>

<p>In other news I've been integrating gmail with monkeypop so I can have decent notifications of mail. I hope to release it soon. Also I have dusted off patchdot. It's pretty dated, buzzco and I are gonna work on getting it running as well. Finally buzzco got trac working for me so i'll make it all available there. I'll prolly post more in the next couple weeks, buy maybe not (vacation till the first :-D) Aight. Peace. </p>
