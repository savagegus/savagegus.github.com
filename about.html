  <p>
    Matthew works at <a href="http://jivesoftware.com">Jive Software</a> as a Staff Engineer. 
    When he's not doing that he practices yoga and bouldering. He lives in north east portland with his wife,
    cat, and dog. He works in Java most days but spends plenty of time in python, ruby, and bash. He's had this
    blog for way to long and just does an awful job of updating it. That is not likely to change.

    Resumes suck, at this point the best place to looks is probably his <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-finlayson/7/984/125/"> LinkedIn</a> profile.
