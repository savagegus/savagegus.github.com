<p>So I built gnome 2.8 on my desktop at home because nautilius decided it didn't know what kind of files it was associated with. And well, frankly that's crap. I like how easy it is to associate applications now, the new themes are sexy, and I don't have to deal with this spatial nautilus stuff no more. So great, sexy, sexy sexy. With all the sex in mind I decided to build 2.8 on my work laptop too. Started it this morning ... emerge: (3 of 111). The worst part is it's downgrading a bunch of packages I recently upgraded. On the upside I get to listen to my hard drive grid away all day. </P>
<p>In other news I have to pee.</p>
