<p>It's one of those amazing weekend mornings that sneak up on me somtimes. I got up early this morning. Now I'm getting through some odds & ends that I've been meaning to tie up. It's cool outside with some steady rain. I have a pot of good coffee and a purring cat resting on my feet. To round it out Iron & Wine is playing quietly in the background.</p>

<p>Good Morning</p>
