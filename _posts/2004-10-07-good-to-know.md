<p>In python a function call always assigns values to all parameters mentioned in the parameter list, either from position arguments, from keyword arguments, or from default values. If the form ``*identifier'' is present, it is initialized to a tuple receiving any excess positional parameters, defaulting to the empty tuple. If the form ``**identifier'' is present, it is initialized to a new dictionary receiving any excess keyword arguments, defaulting to a new empty dictionary.</pr>
<p>It's amzing what you find in documentation. On another note, does anyone else have trouble with system time in linux? mine is never right. I'm thinking about scritping rdate or even setting up my own time server</p>
