title: "Wireless USB Adapter"

SO I have a second machine I'd like to play around with some, problem is we already used the 4 ports on our router. Rather than either set two cards up in my primary machine or get a switch or something I decided to get a wireless card for my extra machine. I picked up a D-Link 802.11b USB Adapter. Works great, really easy to set up. Pretty much I just downloaded linux-wlan-ng, selected the 4th configure option (prism 2.5 USB support), then I made it. TaDa. It's nice when it's that easy.
