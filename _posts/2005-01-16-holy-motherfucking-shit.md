<p>Hello gentle readers, so I did it again. I hit a curb with my GTI, ruined
the driverside wheel and deployed half my airbags. I'm ok but once again my
car is in the shop and I'm out a deductable. What really sucks is I just got
my last deductable back from April when i got hit and my Golf was totaled. The
other thing that sucks is I hit the curb a HALF MILE AWAY FROM THE DEALERSHIP
WHERE I JUST PICKED THE CAR UP FROM BEING FIXED.
Stupid. On a side note, mad props to my friends in Pok. Buzzco came to the
rescue to pick me up and quite a few people checked in to make sure I was ok.
Jeff Bisti even suggested I avoid cars and just get a bike. (The joke there is
I hurt myself worse on a bike than any other wheeled vehical.)
So that happened.</p>
<p>I dunno, in other news I hung out with Eli, Doug & Co. at Noah's for happy
hour last week. Happy hour turned into quite a few hours at the bar, the bar
turned into a trip to the diner, then we all got puppies. It was a great
night. Except the puppies part. That was a lie.</p>
<p>That's about it right now. I'm battling a DMA problem with my 160GB drive
which has made my computer dog slow. Of course my 250GB SATA drive works just
fine but I can't install onto it thanks to an awesome bug in the Debian
Installer (hence the ubuntu installer). Anyway I am going to fix it somehow
until then I will complain.</p>
<p>Freaking piece of crap computer.</p>
