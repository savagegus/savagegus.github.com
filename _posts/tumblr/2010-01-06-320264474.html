<blockquote>Some people turn sad awfully young. No special reason, it seems, but they seem almost to be born that way. They bruise easier, tire faster, cry quicker, remember longer and, as I say, get sadder younger than anyone else in the world. I know, for Iâ€™m one of them.</blockquote>&#8212;Ray Bradbury, Dandelion Wine
