<p>So, things have happened. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ironturtle.org the mightiest server ever died over christmas. Just
	got it running again on friday.</li>
	<li>no blogging for a couple weeks, oddly I caught myself a few times
	meaning to put something on my site and then being a little sad it
	died</li>
	<li>I met a chick with a hook for a hand. When I was introduced to her
	though he hands (or lack thereof) were hidden. I put my hand out to
	shake and was confronted with the hook. CRAP!</li>
	<li>It was my birthday Jan 5th. I am now 25, exactly half my dad's
	age.</li>

	<li>Dowem moved to lovely Poughkeepsie</li>
	<li>Recieved hook wound to hand. Repaired it with those little round
	bandaids that always get leftover from the box of bandaids.</li>
	<li>Doug Kimbell booted in my bathroom.</li>
	<li>My desktop now runs Fedora Core 3. Not sure if I like it
	yet...</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about it. Most of these things would have been their own blog post but
I just can't keep up with that kind of volume.</p>
