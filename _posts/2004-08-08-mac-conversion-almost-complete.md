<p>So I have been macless for almost a week and the switch over to my desktop is almost finished. I have all my thesis writing, all my music and movies, all the odds and ends that I carry from computer to computer. I have my iPod, Casio Camera, and scanner working without a problem. I bought buzzco's Cerwin-Vega's and hooked them to my Panasonic SA-XR25 run through my computer, iPod, and tvtuner. The crowning jewel, Mail.app saves all it's mail in the standard unix mbox format, so I was able to save all my mail in evolution.</p>
<p>I still need to get my hp photosmart 7760 working and my wacom tablet doesn't behave quite right. I also have one outstanding problem someone might be able to clear up for me. I have my camera, usb stick, and iPod that all use scsi emulation of usb. Every time they grab the first available device, since I'm usually only using one at a time they always grab /dev/sda, I would like them to consistently use the same device. Any hints?</p>
