<p>Wednesday night Mike, Marie, Lisa, and I went down to NYC to see Deathcab for Cutie play.</p>

<p>It was a great time, we met the ladies at the poughkeepsie train station and began the adventure. Buzzco and I put back a fair amount of whiskey on the train and the girls had their share of vodka. We got into grand central with time to spare so we grabbed some pizza and beer. Lisa and I had a run in with some rude gay dudes but we survived. We got some more whiskey and got in a cab to get the rest of the way there. At that point I was in no state to navigate and there was a dispute over which direction to go in. (I think buzzco had it right). Turns out drinking in cabs is fun. I had a stupid conversation with the cabbie (I got stuck in the front seat. Marie's a whimp.) There was a huge line but a big pretzel and not having any idea what was going on made things go faster.</p>

<p>Our seats were up in the mezannine. At first I was worried it wouldn't be great but we had a good view of things and the lights looked damn cool from up there. I didn't capture it well on the camera phone but the lighting kept shooting these 50 foot tall shadows of the band while they played. Plus we got to sit and the bar was damn close.</p>

<p>The opener was Youth Group. I was almost expecting a Sunday school chorus, turns out they were just some dudes. They were ok but it didn't seem like their hearts were really in it. If they stick around they may be solid in a couple more years. I spent most of the time drinking and having a very long conversation with Marie, both of us only partially remember what was said but I'm pretty sure we solved the problems of the universe. Anyway. Deathcab was freaking great. They played well, hit every song I wanted to hear (although they played an abridged version of the sound of settling). As you may have guessed I was a little lit so for most of the show Ben had a twin standing next to him playing along. He also kept switching to the keyboards and every time it took me a second to find him. </p>

<p>We hit a bar on the way back, accidentally ordered too many drinks and shot the shit. I saw some movie trailer (i think jennifer aniston is in it) with this terrible line in it: 'I bet I can kiss you without touching your lips' then you kiss the girl and say you're glad you lost. At some point I decided it was time to bust it out. I ended up making out with some girl in the drinks like and I kissed Marie, Lisa, and the waitress. I'm thinking the key to it is to ignore the horror in the random girls eyes as you just kiss her. So that happened.</p>

<p>In all it was a great time. Good music and good friends and all that. I look forward to doing it again.</p>
