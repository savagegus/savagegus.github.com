<p>Heyo. I'm setting up a new webpage inspired by mike doing the same. I have stopped my content management system it's too much of a pain in the ass to write and moveable type is so nice for the rapidly changing content. So instead I'll spend my time working on other projects. (I like the idea of integrating Rendevous into as many things as I can.) First though is the thesis. That's kinda important.</p>
