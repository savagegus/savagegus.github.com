<p>Heyo. So it was a snowy evil day out. I stayed home and worked on various crap. Today I got <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050109102447/http://dev.ironturtle.org/monkey-mail">monkey-mail</a> working kinda. It's something at least. You must have a working install of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050109102447/http://mspace.berlios.de/gunther-user/view.php/page/MonkeyPop">monkeypop</a>. I include the needed version of libgmail. Just edit the monkey.py file at the top for your gmail account settings.</p>
<p>You can check monkey-mail out by:
	<dd>svn co http://dev.ironturtle.org/monkey-mail/svn</dd>
</p>
<p>Yeah, also important to note monkey-mail is a system tray icon to check your gmail and alert you to new mail with on screen displays thanks to monkeypop.</p>
