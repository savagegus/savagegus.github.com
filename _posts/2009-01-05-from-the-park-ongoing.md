<p style="text-align: left;">I’m still sitting in Jamison Park. I don’t always have time during the week to post, so I’ve decided to queue up another bit while I do have a little while. Jamison Park is almost as cool as Tanner SPRINGS Park, it’s about 3 blocks south and is also one city block. It is a basin split in half but a brick wall. Half the basin is filled from a waterfall rolling off of the wall. The basin slowly fills and then empties out like a tide pool. Earlier in the year when it was still summer all these young parents would take their toddlers to wade and splash, it was always a riot to see them milling about amazed when the water drained away then overjoyed as it filled back up. Now in the fall the other half of the basin that is filled with sand is dominated by dog walkers and public art.<br />
I don’t have a segue so I’ll just jump into the follow on to the next topic I wanted to share. Last time I posted about the apartment setup I talked about music. Today is TV.<br />
I have a TiVo HD, which I love. It has downsides, JAMIE AND I tend to have our TV spoon fed to us we know we’ll like it but I rarely stumble upon new shows.<br />
In the office is a little box running Ubuntu hooked up to a 1TB Dlink DNS-321 NAS with a ton of TV. The mac with Popcorn 3 harvests my shows and saves it on the NAS. Then the little Ubuntu box checks for new content from time to time. Breaks the DRM (shh don’t tell the MPAA) and then serves it back up through pyTivo. Then the shows I really like (Lately House, Mad Men, and selected episodes of Good Eats) are served up for later consumption.<br />
PyTivo is a cool piece of software, as the name indicates it’s a little python program that masquerades as another TiVo on the network. From the now playing list you can browse to the ubuntu box and transfer any show. In and of itself this is cool, however pyTivo has another trick up its sleeve. It converts programs on the fly from whatever format they are to the TiVo format through ffmpeg. This saves me from messing with the native formats or locking myself into the TiVO forever. Snazzy stuff.</p>
