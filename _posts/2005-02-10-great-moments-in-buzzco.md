<p>A little context. I had mentioned saying screw this and moving to Prince
Edwards Island and starting a small company a couple days ago. This morning
while buzzco, eli, and I were complaining about work the following occurred.
</p>
<p><b>Buzzco:</b> Or we could just say screw it and move to prince albert island</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> uhhh, maybe prince edwards island?</p>
<p><b>Eli:</b> hahaha</p>

<p>That didn't really translate well to a blog post but imagine this dear
reader. Buzzco singing and frolicking around on an island made entirely of
cocks. Then he trips....</p>
