<p>Ok, so I'm writing this post in Tomboy as the day goes on. I've been meaning to post all week but I haven't gotten around to it. Currently on the dockit:<p>

<h3>Postdam Visit</h3>
<p>I went up to potsdam last week, from thursday to sunday. I worked in the COSI lab on Friday and had a good time and got a suprising amount done. Met with doug on my thesis and things are going ahead for december. There are photos <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20041127112034/http://zetanu.net/original/www/index.php?galerie=Halloween%202004"> here.</a></p>

<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Clean quick intstall, great package manager, sane defaults, plenty of documentation through Ubuntu and Debian. I have everything working on my work laptop; MTS, Notes, Sametime and I now have home rolled deb packages for all the above. I have to say is was skeptical but I am impressed now. </p>

<p>I have also chosen to install ubuntu on my desktop at home, I ran into a problem though. It didn't like my SATA drive. Luckily since I wanted to install on my IDE drive I just disabled SATA in my BIOS and that fixed the problem. The weird thing about it was the error was about not being able to detect the IDE cdrom it booted off of. oh well.</p>

<h3>X-Men Legends</h3>

<p>Rocks.</p>
