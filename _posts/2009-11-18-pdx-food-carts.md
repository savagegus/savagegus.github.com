<p>Shortly after I moved to Portland I was at a business conference telling co-workers how much I liked it. Another dude at the table was from San Francisco turned to me and said,</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Seriously? Portland, it has the worst of the weather and the worst food on the west coast, you could have at least made it to Seattle.&#8221; </i></p>
<p>I&#8217;d only been a resident for a couple weeks and didn&#8217;t have the ammo to back up what I thought was a pretty decent scene. Since then I&#8217;ve come to know and love Portland food.
