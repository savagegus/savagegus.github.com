<p>So another thanksgiving has come and gone. I spent this one in Hydeville, VT with my folks, alicia, and adrian. Dinner was great and it's been relaxing, tristram is coming up later today to chill, so that will be nice too.</p>

<p>In a new thanksgiving tradition my mom got a bit trashed and started calling family members which is always solid entertainment. After dinner we all had cheap cigars and went to the bar in front of my parents store called 'the dog'. I had lots of cheap beer on top of thanksgiving dinner (awesome feeling) and beat my family at pool. So that happened.</p>

<p>In other news I found a recipe for cooking salmon in the dishwasher. This is how it went:</p>
<ul>
<li>First get salmon. You also need some seasoning for the fish, tinfoil, and a dishwasher. It also is quite important to check the expiration date on the salmon ... this would have been useful knowledge for me at this point.</li>
<li>Now you need to get a 12" square of tinfoil. Place the fillet on the tinfoil and cover with whatever you want. I used lemon juice and some spices that looked appropriate. The actual recipe calls for a dill sauce, so maybe next time I'll try that.</li>
<li>Now you want to seal the salmon in the tinfoil. Crimp all the edges and try to force all air out of the tinfoil. Use a second layer of foil if you need, you really don't want this getting filled with water or releasing fish particles into your dishwasher. Put them on the top rack and let it got for a normal cycle.</li>
<li>Now the moment of truth, take it out and unwrap the salmon carefully. You don't want to get burned by fish steam. It should be a nice pinkish color I guess. Thanks to buzzco's googling we discovered that the skin (which is face down in the photos) should lift easily off the fish when it is done.</li>

<p>However, as I was saying before check the expiration date FIRST. You see, when I was checking to see if the fish was well poached I ran a fork along the skin to lift it off. It did come right off but it also released a fair amount of brown goo and a lovely oder that made the cats run away. Needless to say I didn't eat the salmon but I do plan on trying this again. I think I'll need to add some vegtables to their own tinfoil pouch in order to cut down on the water waste (although I'm told it uses much less energy than baking the fish). Also, I was a little concerned that my dish washer would smell like a pornstar's changing room after this one but ... GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!, the tinfoil seemed to hold it back. That is all.</p>
