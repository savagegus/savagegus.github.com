I spent a little time working on my blog. I have a layout I really like although it still needs some fixing. I managed to put in some plugins like my now playing one, catagories, and I got a very hacked version of the booklist plugin working with amazon after dome discussion with jay huie. I'd love some feedback or suggestions of what else should be there.
