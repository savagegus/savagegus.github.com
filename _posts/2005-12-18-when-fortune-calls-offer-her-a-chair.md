This week is the start of my vacation, I don't have any big plans. I'm going to
see Deathcab in NYC on weds with Mike, Marie, and Lisa. Thursday I plan on going up to Burlington to hang out with Tristram. Other than that I'm just hiping to
get through a bunch of crap I've been meaning to do around the house and hopefully finish up my mambo component for the ZN website.

</p>
<p>Along the lines of finishing up crap around the house I'm cleaning out my room and I plan on putting a ton of shit of ebay and just clearing out the pile of
stuff that's just sat in my closet for the past year. In said closet I found an
old tapestery that I got in college and haven't seemed to find a place for since I started in the real world. Rather than just toss it I decided to use it to cover my old office chair which was looking pretty foul after having it for five or six years.
</p>
<p> It was pretty easy to do I basically took it apart and cut a couple sections to size of the seat and back and then stapled it on. It took like a half hour and I was pretty happy with the results.</p>
